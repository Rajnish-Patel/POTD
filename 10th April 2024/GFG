You are given an integer array arr[] of size n, representing n number of people in a party, each person is denoted by an integer. 
Couples are represented by the same number ie: two people have the same integer value, it means they are a couple. Find out the only 
single person in the party of couples.

NOTE: It is guarantee that there exist only one single person in the party.



// Solution :-


class Solution{
    public:
    int findSingle(int n, int arr[]){
        
        // int res = 0;
        // for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        // {
        //     res ^= arr[i];
        // }
        
        // return res;
        
        
        
        
        sort(arr, arr+n);
        int i=0;
        while(i<n)
        {
            if(arr[i] != arr[i+1]) return arr[i];
            else i = i+2;
        }
    }
};
