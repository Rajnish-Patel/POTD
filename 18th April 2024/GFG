You are given an integer n and an integer array arr of size n+2. All elements of the array are in the range from 1 to n. Also, all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers.
Note: Return the numbers in their order of appearing twice. So, if X and Y are the repeating numbers, and X's second appearance comes before second appearance of Y, then the order should be (X, Y).



// Solution :-

class Solution {
  public:
    //Function to find two repeated elements.
    vector<int> twoRepeated (int arr[], int n) {
        // Your code here
         int x=-1;
        int y=-1;
        int maxi=1e5+7;
        
        for(int i=0;i<(n+2);i++)
        {
            int ind=arr[i]%maxi;
            int original=arr[ind-1]%maxi;
            int marked=arr[ind-1]/maxi;
            
            if(marked)
            {
                if(x==-1)
                x=ind;
                else if(y==-1)
                {
                    y=ind;
                    break;
                }
            }
            arr[ind-1]=(1*maxi)+original;
        }
        return {x,y};
    }
};
