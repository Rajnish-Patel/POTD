There are n stairs, and a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. 
Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does not matter).



// Solution :-

class Solution {
  public:
    long long countWays(int n) {
        // your code here
        return (n/2)+1;
    }
};
