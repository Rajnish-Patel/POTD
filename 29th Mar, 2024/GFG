Medium  Accuracy: 54.88%   Submissions: 14K+  Points: 4
Eulerian Path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. Eulerian Circuit is an Eulerian Path that starts and ends on the same vertex. 
Given the number of vertices v and adjacency list adj denoting the graph. Find that there exists the Euler circuit or not. Return 1 if there exist  
alteast one eulerian path else 0.


//Solution:-
//Idea :- Use the Degree-Rule Concept, if the degree of every vertices is even then it is euler graph and hence it contains eulerian circuit.

class Solution {
public:
	bool isEularCircuitExist(int v, vector<int>adj[]){
	    // Code here
	    for(int i=0;i<v;i++)
	    {
            int rem=0;
            
            for(auto x:adj[i])
            {
                rem++;
            }
            
            if(rem%2!=0) return 0;
        }
        return 1;
	}
